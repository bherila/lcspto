            <p align="center">
  Bernards Township Public Schools <br /> <strong>Liberty Corner Intramural Program</strong><br /> <strong>Intramural Program Coordinator </strong><br /> <strong>Andrew Henthorn 204-2550-ext. 326</strong><br /> <strong>Ahenthorn@bernardsboe.com</strong><br />
</p>

<p>Dear Families,</p>

<p>Plans for the Liberty Corner's 1st -5th grade intramural seasons are underway.  There are three seasons per year; Fall, Winter, and Spring.  Each season will be 7 weeks long and each session will run from 3:15-4:15, Mondays (grades 1, 2 &amp; 3), Tuesdays (grades 3, 4 &amp; 5), Thursdays (grades 1, 2 &amp; 3) and Fridays (grades 3, 4 &amp; 5).    Notice, 3rd grade can choose to go with the older children or younger children.  I believe this flexibility will give the 3rd graders the opportunity to play with the group that best suits them developmentally and/or socially.  The schedule for each session is attached to this notice.  Our limit for participants is <strong>25</strong> students per day. If space allows, your child may register for an additional session (both days) however, an additional fee will be required.    </p>

<p><strong>Fee: $60 per session (one day a week for 7 weeks), $120 per two sessions (both days).</strong><br />
Make check payable to: <strong>Liberty Corner Elementary School</strong>. </p>

<p>Registration at this time is for the Fall, Winter, or Spring Season.  Registration will be open throughout the year, provided there are openings.<br />
Confirmation of participation will be sent home prior to the seasons start via <strong>e-mail.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Please</strong> <strong>remember to include your E-mail address on the registration form</strong>. Please place your check and your child's permission slip, in an envelope marked "Intramural Program"¬ù and return it to your child's teacher<strong>.  <em>*</strong>Fall participant registration must be received by Friday, September 16th</em>*. The Fall session will start on Monday, September 19th.</p>

<p><strong>Attendance will be taken at each daily session.  If your child is in school and will not be attending his/her regularly scheduled session, a note or call to that affect is required (204-2550 ext. 326).   If your child is scheduled to attend intramurals and does not go to his/her session, we will be obligated to call home and then call emergency numbers.  **Children are to be picked up after intramurals promptly at 4:15</strong>.  Pick up is at the back of the gymnasium.  Any child that is picked up late or does not attend when scheduled, without excuse may lose their privilege to attend.  Please retain this page, schedule, and rules for participation for your records.  </p>

<h3>Activities</h3>

<p>Activities for the intramural program will include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cooperative games, group challenges, problem-solving activities, sports</li>
<li>Outside snow activities<em>* *</em>in the <em>*winter season *</em>and lots of  FUN!!</li>
</ul>

            <h3>From the Principal&#39;s Desk</h3>
            <p>It was wonderful to see so many of you there to "follow the yellow brick road" with us on April 26 at the Ridge High School PAC.  Culminating a 7 week mini-unit, seventy children presented the LCS production of "The Wizard of Oz."  It was amazing to see such commitment and dedication in action.  During the 7 weeks of preparation, the children learned lines, practiced staging/acting, created amazing scenery and props and practiced stagehand  responsibilities.  All the children worked very hard and collaborated with each other to create a magnificent final product.  Countless parents got involved to create the field of poppies, assemble costumes and provide props.  It really was a "village" effort and we are thankful, as always, for the parental support and encouragement.</p>

<p>Special thanks go out to our wonderful directors.  Mrs. Bubnowski and Mrs. Clark worked with the children to help with learning lines and acting methods, while Ms. Bynoe and Mrs. Finazzo did an amazing job creating sets, scenery and props.  Of course, our wonderful music teacher, Mrs. Beadle, was our Musical Director Extraordinaire.  These faculty members gave much additional time outside of the mini-unit time to get the children prepared and ready to perform for their families and friends at the PAC.  We also appreciate the support of Mr. Fackelman, Supervisor of Fine Arts, for ensuring the availability of the PAC for our performance.</p>

<p>A great time was had by all as Dorothy clicked her heels three times and finally returned home to Kansas.  Kudos to 
everyone involved!</p>
