  Bernards Township Public Schools <br /> <strong>Liberty Corner Intramural Program</strong><br /> <strong>Intramural Program Coordinator </strong><br /> <strong>Andrew Henthorn 204-2550-ext. 326</strong><br /> <strong>Ahenthorn@bernardsboe.com</strong><br />
</p>

<p>Dear Families,</p>

<p>Plans for the Liberty Corner's 1st -5th grade intramural seasons are underway.  There are three seasons per year; Fall, Winter, and Spring.  Each season will be 7 weeks long and each session will run from 3:15-4:15, Mondays (grades 1, 2 &amp; 3), Tuesdays (grades 3, 4 &amp; 5), Thursdays (grades 1, 2 &amp; 3) and Fridays (grades 3, 4 &amp; 5).    Notice, 3rd grade can choose to go with the older children or younger children.  I believe this flexibility will give the 3rd graders the opportunity to play with the group that best suits them developmentally and/or socially.  The schedule for each session is attached to this notice.  Our limit for participants is <strong>25</strong> students per day. If space allows, your child may register for an additional session (both days) however, an additional fee will be required.    </p>

<p><strong>Fee: $60 per session (one day a week for 7 weeks), $120 per two sessions (both days).</strong><br />
Make check payable to: <strong>Liberty Corner Elementary School</strong>. </p>

<p>Registration at this time is for the Fall, Winter, or Spring Season.  Registration will be open throughout the year, provided there are openings.<br />
Confirmation of participation will be sent home prior to the seasons start via <strong>e-mail.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Please</strong> <strong>remember to include your E-mail address on the registration form</strong>. Please place your check and your child's permission slip, in an envelope marked "Intramural Program" and return it to your child's teacher<strong>.  <em>*</strong>Fall participant registration must be received by Friday, September 16th</em>*. The Fall session will start on Monday, September 19th.</p>

<p><strong>Attendance will be taken at each daily session.  If your child is in school and will not be attending his/her regularly scheduled session, a note or call to that affect is required (204-2550 ext. 326).   If your child is scheduled to attend intramurals and does not go to his/her session, we will be obligated to call home and then call emergency numbers.  **Children are to be picked up after intramurals promptly at 4:15</strong>.  Pick up is at the back of the gymnasium.  Any child that is picked up late or does not attend when scheduled, without excuse may lose their privilege to attend.  Please retain this page, schedule, and rules for participation for your records.  </p>

<h3>Activities</h3>

<p>Activities for the intramural program will include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cooperative games, group challenges, problem-solving activities, sports</li>
<li>Outside snow activities<em>* *</em>in the <em>*winter season *</em>and lots of  FUN!!</li>
</ul>

<h1>Intramural Program Rules and Procedures</h1>

<ol>
<li>Sneakers and proper attire must be worn if participation is expected.</li>
<li>Intramural participation is a privilege and participants will be suspended if inappropriate behaviors are exhibited.  Children are to demonstrate the same behaviors expected in their Physical Education classes.</li>
<li>If a student is in school, he or she is expected to attend intramurals on the day they are registered.  If for some reason they are not able to attend, <u>a note or call from home is required</u> (Andrew Henthorn 204-2550 x 326) stating that the student will not be attending intramurals.  Please explain to your child that he or she is required to go to intramurals unless they have a note.  We must account for all students who are expected at our intramural program.  Conversely, if your child is absent from school, he or she cannot be brought to school for intramural participation.  </li>
<li>If your child will be car pooling, walking or riding a bike, we must also receive written permission to do so.  One note will suffice for the duration of the session.  Whenever your child's dismissal procedure is changed, a written request from the parent is mandated. </li>
<li>Students will be dismissed from intramurals promptly at 4:15.  Any child that is picked up late or does not attend when scheduled, without excuse, may lose their privilege to attend.</li>
<li>If a student is medically excused from Physical Education class, they are also medically excused from intramurals. </li>
</ol>

<p>Intramural participation is a privilege and participation will be suspended if rules and procedures are not followed.<u></u></p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your continued cooperation!</p>
